Hello, I'm Balthazar

I've started to sing and play music since I was 10 years old. At the age of 16 I got my first electric guitar and assembled my first music band with some friends from school, we played mostly rock covers. Around the same time I composed my first song.

I played on different bands, Maquiavelico Johnson, Fondo Blanco and Bimodal, doing weekly rehearsals and playing live at different places, but we never had the chance to record anything.

After finishing high school I started studying at Juan José Castro Conservatory of Music, but after a year I left and went back to study with private teachers since I didn´t agree with their methodology and I wanted to be able to learn the topics which interested me.

In 2007 I joined Equilibrio**, **and since every member was very dedicated to it, I finally had the chance to record songs, this first recording practice was the beginning of a new passion.

Three years later I decided to move to Europe and before leaving Argentina, the place where I was born, I made a demo of my most popular songs.

My travels around Europe and the experience I had recording music with Equilibrio, made me realize that I wanted to study audio production, so in 2012 I started studying at the SAE Institute in London. I got my bachelor degree four years later and since then I started to dedicate my full time to my passion.
