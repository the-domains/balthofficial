Hello, I'm Balthazar

I've Started to sing and play guitar when I was 10 years old (1995), at the age of 16 (2001) got my first electric guitar and created my first music band following that around the same year I've composed my first song.   
Started as a classic rock assemble playing just covers, and later on I've jumped into 3 different bands playing live and doing weekly rehearsals but never recorded anything.   
After finishing High-school started the conservatory of music for a year but didn't like the way they teach and opened myself to private teachers again.   
Finally in 2007 joined another band that was very professional and recorded some songs, my first recording experience and the beginning of a new passion. In 2010 decided to move to Europe and before that made a demo of my most popular songs.   
After that I realized that I wanted to study audio production and I've finished my bachelor degree in 2016 at SAE Institute in London.
